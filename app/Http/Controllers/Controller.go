// Package controllers holds this application's controllers.
//
// The directory is app/Http/Controllers, in CamelCase, which is where people
// look for it. The package name follows Go and stays lowercase.
//
// A controller reads the request, calls a service and renders. It never reaches
// the database: a controller holding a repository is a controller that skipped
// the service, and therefore skipped the policy, and `aru doctor` refuses it.

// grows authorize(), validate() and dispatch() grows them because there is

// only what is about answering a request, and a controller's collaborators are
// fields it declares and the constructor sets.

// and HTMX still swaps the fragment either way, so nothing looks wrong until
// somebody asks why the success rate is 100%.
