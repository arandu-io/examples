// Package providers holds this application's own modules.

// A provider here is a kernel.Module: it has a name, it registers routes, and it

// service provider in the container sense -- there is nothing to bind into and
// no deferred resolution, because every dependency is constructed in
// bootstrap/app.go and passed in by hand.
//
// The name survives anyway, and on purpose: this is the file somebody opens
// looking for "where the application registers itself".
