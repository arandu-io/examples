// EventLog is what this application does with a domain event once it has
// committed: it writes it down.
//
// It implements events.Publisher, which is the whole of what the relay needs.
// An application with somewhere else to send events replaces this one value in
// bootstrap/app.go and changes nothing else -- NATS, a webhook, a queue and an
// in-process handler are all this shape from here.
//
// Writing the event down is the floor rather than a placeholder. The three
// events this application stores are auth.user.registered, auth.email.verified
// and auth.password.reset, and each is something somebody has to be able to
// answer a question about months later. A line carrying the tenant and the
// action that authorized the write is that answer, and there is nowhere cheaper
// to put it.
//
// # Delivery is at-least-once
//
// The relay can hand the same event over twice: a publish that succeeded and a
// mark that did not look identical from in here. So whatever a listener does has
// to be safe to do again, and a repeated line is the cheapest shape of that --
// an upsert keyed by Stored.ID and a call carrying an idempotency key are the
// others. Nothing checks it, because a repeat is a property of what the code
// does rather than of what it looks like.
type EventLog struct {
	// A listener's collaborators are fields, set where it is wired. This one has
	// none: the logger arrives on the context, and reaching for a global instead
	// is what makes a listener no test can pin.
}

// NewEventLog returns the listener.
func NewEventLog() *EventLog { return &EventLog{} }

// The relay is built with this value, so a signature that stops matching the
// interface has to fail here rather than at the line that wires it.
var _ events.Publisher = (*EventLog)(nil)

// Publish writes one committed event down, with the audit trail its row carries.
//
// The three fields after the identity are the ones that cannot be reconstructed
// afterwards: the tenant the event belongs to, the subject whose Grant
// authorized the write, and the action that Grant was minted for. They were
// sealed into the row inside the transaction that produced it, and this is where
// they leave the database.
//
// The payload is deliberately not among them. It is whatever JSON the producer
// stored -- an address and a name, for the events this application emits -- and
// a log aggregator is the wrong home for either. A listener that needs it
// decodes it with Stored.Decode into a struct declared beside itself, never one
// shared with the producer: a consumer compiled against the producer's type is a
// consumer that has to be deployed with it.
//
// An error here means "not delivered": the relay keeps the event, counts the
// attempt with the reason, and parks it once the attempts run out. Returning nil
// over a failure loses the event silently, which is the one outcome the outbox
// exists to prevent. Nothing here can fail, so nothing here returns one.
