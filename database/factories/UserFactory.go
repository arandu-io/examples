// Package factories builds domain objects with sensible values.
//
// A seeder or a test says what it cares about and the factory fills the rest.
//
// # Two shapes, and the line between them is the Grant
//
// UserFactory below is the hand-written one: it returns a value and stores
// nothing, so the storing is a repository call, and a repository call needs a
// Grant.
//
// Categories is the typed model factory, and it can store -- but only through
// Create, which takes the Grant every write in this collection takes and files
// the row under data.Tenant(g). Make, beside it, takes none and touches nothing.
// The two signatures are the guarantee: a factory is not a back door around the
// policy that guards the table, and the way you can tell which half you are in
// is whether you had to hold a Grant to get there.
