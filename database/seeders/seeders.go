// Package seeders holds the database seeders of this project.
//
// The shape is the conventional one: DatabaseSeeder is the entry point, it calls
// the other seeders in order, and `aru db:seed <name>` runs a single one. A
// seeder is a type satisfying an interface rather than a class discovered by
// reflection -- so a seeder that does not compile is caught at build time, not
// when someone runs it against production.
