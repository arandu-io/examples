// Package seeders holds the database seeders of this project.

// The shape is the conventional one: DatabaseSeeder is the entry point, it calls the
// other seeders in order, and `aru db:seed --class=<name>` runs a single one.
// The difference is that a seeder here is a type satisfying an interface rather
// than a class discovered by reflection -- so a seeder that does not compile is
// caught at build time, not when someone runs it against production.
