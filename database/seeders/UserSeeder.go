// It is the operator's door, and it exists because the alternative keeps coming
// up: the first administrator of a fresh deployment, or somebody locked out
// before the mail transport is configured, cannot use the reset link -- there is
// nowhere for it to go.
//
// # The password is on the command line, and that has a cost
//
// It lands in the shell history and it is visible in `ps` to anybody on the
// machine while the command runs. That is a real exposure and it is the reason
// the environment-variable form existed. It is stated on stdout every time this
// runs, rather than in a comment nobody reads, and the command prints how to
// clear the history line.
//
// The mitigation that does not need a second way to pass a secret: run it, then
// change the password from the application. This command is for getting in.
//
// # Why -upd is a flag and not the default
//
// Creating is safe to repeat and updating is not: a seeder that silently reset
// the password of an existing account would lock somebody out the second time
// somebody ran `aru db:seed` after adding this. Without -upd, an address that is
// already there is left exactly as it is, and the command says so.
