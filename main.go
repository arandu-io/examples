// Command arandu is the entry point of this application.
//
// It is both halves of what is usually two artifacts, a front controller and a
// console script: the binary is the server, and the same binary is the command
// line. There is no front controller and no document root, because in Go the
// process listens itself.
//
// Almost nothing is here. The wiring is bootstrap/app.go and the commands are
// bootstrap/console.go, because `main` cannot be imported: anything living here
// is anything a test cannot reach -- and the tests worth having boot the whole
// application.
//
// `aru serve` runs this binary with that argument, because only this binary
// knows which modules exist.
