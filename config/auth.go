// refuses an empty tenant, because a system grant with no tenant reads across

// still writes every row under this value, so growing into multi-tenant later is
// a change of resolver and not a migration of data.

// table -- and a second configurable path would be a second way to do one
// thing.

// It does not hold the session lifetime either, and that is a removal rather
// than an omission. SESSION_TTL was read here as well as in Session, into a
// field nothing ever asked for: the store is built from Session.TTL, so the
// copy here answered no question and would have answered a different one the
// day either read grew a rule the other had not. One variable, one reader.
