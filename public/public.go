// Package public serves the files a browser or a crawler asks for by a fixed
// path.
//
// Everything else this application ships is content-addressed: the stylesheet
// and the scripts live in the framework, are embedded in the binary, and are
// served from /_arandu/assets/<hash>/ with a URL the page writes for itself.
// These two cannot work that way. /favicon.ico and /robots.txt are addresses
// the client chooses, not addresses the application hands out, so the name has
// to stay exactly what it is and the hash has nowhere to go.
//
// That is the whole reason this package exists, and the reason it is not a
// second asset pipeline (RULE 9): one path for anything a page references, this
// one for the short list of names the outside world already knows.
//
// There is no document root here either. A public/ directory is what a web
// server points at; ours is compiled into the binary like everything else, so
// the deploy stays one artifact and `git clone && aru dev` answers these URLs
// with nothing mounted and nothing published.
//
// Adding a file means adding it to the go:embed line below. Its extension has
// to be in contentTypes, or the build fails -- a file served with the wrong
// type is a file the browser quietly ignores.
