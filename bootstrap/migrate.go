// The migration commands are the component's, not this file's.
//
// They used to be four functions here -- migrate, rollback, status, fresh --
// reimplementing what database/console/migrations already exports as eight, and
// the four were the four somebody had needed so far. migrate:install,
// migrate:reset, migrate:refresh and make:migration did not exist in this
// application because nobody had written them a second time.
//
// None of them runs at boot, and none is reachable from the start-up path.
// `aru migrate` is a step of the deployment pipeline: with N replicas rolling, a
// migrator called from main means N of them racing over one table.
//
// This said "there is no schema builder" and that a migration's statements are
// SQL written in the portable subset every supported database shares. The
// migrations in database/migrations/ are written with the Blueprint now, and the
// portable subset was never a subset: MySQL refuses TEXT in a key without a
// prefix length, which is the rule this repository documented in a comment and
// the forum application then broke on every column it had. The builder is what
// makes one migration run on three engines, and it hides nothing -- aru migrate
// --pretend prints the statements it sends.

// migrationConnection is the name this application's single connection is
// registered under.
//
// A migration that names no connection runs on the default one, which is this,
// so the name is only ever written down by a migration that sets
// BaseMigration.Connection to reach somewhere else.
const migrationConnection = "default"

// migrationsTable is where the names of the applied migrations are recorded.
//
// It is not migrations.DefaultTable, which is "migrations", and the difference
// is the whole reason this constant is written down. Every database this
// application has ever migrated recorded into "arandu_migrations", and a run
// that looked anywhere else would read an empty table: every migration pending,
// every statement sent again against tables that are already there, and the
// first error arriving from the engine rather than from the migrator.
//
// A project starting today would take the default. This one cannot, because
// renaming the table is a data migration nobody wrote.
const migrationsTable = "arandu_migrations"

// modulePath is the group the registered modules' migrations are put in.
//
// It is spelled like a path because that is what `--path=` takes, and nothing
// opens it: it is a key, kept apart from the application's own group so the two
// halves stay tellable apart in a listing.
const modulePath = "modules"

// migrationDirectory is where make:migration writes a new file.
//
// It is a directory and not a group, which is the distinction Deps keeps in two
// fields: the application's own migrations register under the default group, so
// the group the commands read is nil and this is where the file goes.
const migrationDirectory = "database/migrations"

// isolationLockTTL is how long an isolated command may hold the lock.
//
// It is the deadlock protection and nothing else: a process that dies partway
// through holds the lock until it expires, and every later run waits it out. So
// it is sized above the longest migration there is rather than against the
// usual one, and an hour of refused runs after a crash is the price of a lock
// that cannot expire under a migrator still using it. The other failure is the
// one that cannot be undone -- two migrators altering one table.
const isolationLockTTL = time.Hour

// newMigrator wires the migrator the migration commands run.
//
// The migrations component reaches a connection through a resolver rather than
// being handed one, because a migration may name the connection it runs on.
// This application opens exactly one, so the resolver holds exactly one.
//
// database.ForMigrations, which MigrationResolver applies on the way out, is
// what supplies the transaction per migration and the statement capture
// --pretend prints: the adapted connection answers both of the optional
// interfaces the migrator asks for.
//
// The modules' migrations are put in the registry here because that is the
// only place the migrator reads. A module is a value the kernel already holds,
// so it is asked for them rather than announcing them from init() the way the
// application's own do -- and rollback and status look a recorded name up in
// the registry, so a module's migration that never reached it would be reported
// as missing and skipped at the moment somebody needs it undone.
//
// Output goes to stdout because the migrator prints each migration and how it
// turned out. Nothing below reprints what it already said.
