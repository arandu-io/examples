// The migration commands are the conventional ones, because the steps of a
// deploy should be the ones a developer already knows: migrate,
// migrate:rollback, migrate:status, migrate:fresh.
//
// None of them runs at boot, and none of them is reachable from the start-up
// path. `aru migrate` is a step of the deployment pipeline: with N replicas
// rolling, a migrator called from main means N of them racing over one table.
//
// There is no schema builder. A migration hands its statements to the
// connection, and those statements are SQL, written once in the portable subset
// every supported database shares, so what you read is what runs. A schema
// builder exists where an ORM hides the database; here the point is that nothing
// hides it.

// migrationConnection is the name this application's single connection is
// registered under.
//
// A migration that names no connection runs on the default one, which is this,
// so the name is only ever written down by a migration that sets
// BaseMigration.Connection to reach somewhere else.
const migrationConnection = "default"

// modulePath is the group the registered modules' migrations are put in.
//
// It is spelled like a path because that is what `--path=` takes, and nothing
// opens it: it is a key, kept apart from the application's own group so the two
// halves stay tellable apart in a listing.
const modulePath = "modules"

// migrationsTable is where the names of the applied migrations are recorded.
//
// It is not migrations.DefaultTable, which is "migrations", and the difference
// is the whole reason this constant is written down. Every database this
// application has ever migrated recorded into "arandu_migrations", and a run
// that looked anywhere else would read an empty table: every migration pending,
// every CREATE TABLE sent again against tables that are already there, and the
// first error arriving from the engine rather than from the migrator.
//
// A project starting today would take the default. This one cannot, because
// renaming the table is a data migration nobody wrote.
const migrationsTable = "arandu_migrations"

// newMigrator wires the migrator the four migration commands run.
//
// The migrations component reaches a connection through a resolver rather than
// being handed one, because a migration may name the connection it runs on.
// This application opens exactly one, so the resolver holds exactly one.
//
// database.ForMigrations, which MigrationResolver applies on the way out, is
// what supplies the transaction per migration and the statement capture
// --pretend prints: the adapted connection answers both of the optional
// interfaces the migrator asks for.
//
// The modules' migrations are put in the registry here because that is the
// only place the migrator reads. A module is a value the kernel already holds,
// so it is asked for them rather than announcing them from init() the way this
// application's own do -- and rollback and status look a recorded name up in
// the registry, so a module's migration that never reached it would be reported
// as missing and skipped at the moment somebody needs it undone.
//
// Output goes to stdout because the migrator prints each migration and how it
// turned out. Nothing below reprints what it already said.
