# One artifact: a static binary in a distroless image.
#
# No runtime, no package manager, no shell. The image is what doc 17 promises
# and what every platform consumes -- Dokploy, Coolify, Kamal, Fly, Railway, ECS
# and Kubernetes all take an OCI image and need nothing else from us.

FROM golang:1.25-alpine AS build

# git for the version stamp, and libstdc++ for the Tailwind binary. There is no
# node, no python and no build toolchain here, which is the point of RULE 13.
#
# libstdc++ is not a toolchain: it is the C++ runtime the standalone tailwindcss
# is linked against, and Alpine ships neither it nor libgcc by default. Two
# errors in a row named this, and the second one is the readable half:
#
#   fork/exec …/tailwindcss-v4.3.3: no such file or directory
#   Error loading shared library libstdc++.so.6: No such file or directory
#
# The first was the glibc build on a musl system -- the loader missing, reported
# as the file missing. `aru` downloads the musl build now, and with the right
# loader the binary can finally say what it actually wants.
#
# No gcompat: that is Alpine's glibc shim, and it would be papering over the
# first error rather than fixing it.

# CGO off is what makes the binary static and what lets distroless run it. The
# SQLite driver is pure Go for exactly this reason.
#
# -trimpath keeps the build machine's paths out of the binary, so a stack trace
# from production does not name somebody's home directory.

# The views, compiled in the image rather than copied in.
#
# They are build output and are not in the repository (see .gitignore), so the
# binary would not link without this. Installing the CLI here costs a layer and
# buys the property that the image is built from sources only -- nothing in it
# came from somebody's laptop.
# Pinned, not @latest.
#
# An image built from @latest depends on when it was built, which is the one
# property an image is supposed to not have: two builds of the same commit
# produce different binaries and nobody can say which is deployed.
#
# It is also what @latest costs in practice -- the module proxy caches that
# endpoint separately from the version list, so a fresh release is in the list
# and not yet the answer to @latest, and a build picks up the version before the
# fix for an hour.
