// booting anything. A `_test.go` anywhere else is the arrangement this project
// moved away from -- a source file and its test side by side, doubling every
// listing with files nobody opens on purpose.
//
// Two exceptions, and neither is a preference:
//
//   - a test that reads an unexported identifier cannot live in another package.
//     Go decides that, not this project.
//   - a module of its own -- assets/ embeds the compiled stylesheet -- owns its
//     tests, because it is a package that ships on its own.

// a test in it opens a database.

// It is checked by what a file reaches for, not by what it is called. A Unit
// test that boots the kernel is in the wrong suite whatever its name is -- and
