// Package routes is where this application declares what it answers.

// Two files: web.go for what a browser reaches, and
// console.go for what the command line does. There is no api.go -- the handler
// decides between a JSON body and an HTML fragment, and a second router for the
// same resources would be a second place to forget a policy (doc 28).

// Resource registers only the actions the controller implements, so a route that
// exists is a route that answers.

	// including /_arandu/debug when the console is not mounted. The {$} anchors
	// the match to the end of the path, which is what Route::get('/') means.

	// public package. Without this line the icon in the tab is a 404.
